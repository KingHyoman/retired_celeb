# Retired Celeb

## Motivation
Celebrities with controversial on-air behavior should not appear on the show<br/>
In the past, controversial celebrities were edited by editors who watched the footage in its entirety

## Idea
Step 1. Using Face Recognition to recognize the target face who have to be edited<br/>
Step 2. Change the target face to another face using Face Swap

## Process
### Face_Recognition
Recognize target faces in a given video
### Face_Swap
model 1: Low performance(x)<br/>
model 2: Face Detection + Face Swap
